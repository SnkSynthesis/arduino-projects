# Potentiometer Password Verifier

This is a circuit that uses a potentiometer as a form of input, in order to modify a 9 digit array of numbers.
This 9 digit array of numbers can be submitted to see if it is equal to the true password.

## Usage: 
1. Use the potentiometer dial to move thru the digits (left or right) during selection mode (solid yellow LED)
2. Use the potentiometer to edit the selected digit during editing mode (blinking yellow LED).
3. To change modes, press the upper push-button
   * Blinking Yellow LED - editing mode
   * Solid Yellow LED - selection mode
4. Once the digits have been modified as desired, press the lower push button to submit the password.
5. To reset to try again, press the reset button on the Arduino.
